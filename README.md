# language_textsummerizer
this model aims at summarizing of large text.  Telugu is selected as the language of study, and Python as the implementation tool for efficient text summarization. The approach is extractive, assessing sentence importance through term frequency. Sentence tokenization is achieved using the Indic library, forming a bag of words for frequency calculation. Sentences are ranked by sorting values in descending order and normalizing them. Sentences surpassing a defined threshold are extracted, contributing to the role of natural language processing in summarization.
